# NumPy

# The name “Numpy” stands for “Numerical Python”. It is the commonly used library. It is a popular machine 
# learning library that supports large matrices and multi-dimensional data. It consists of in-built
# mathematical functions for easy computations. Even libraries like TensorFlow use Numpy internally to perform
# several operations on tensors. Array Interface is one of the key features of this library.

# Pandas

# Pandas are an important library for data scientists. It is an open-source machine learning library that 
# provides flexible high-level data structures and a variety of analysis tools. It eases data analysis, 
# data manipulation, and cleaning of data. Pandas support operations like Sorting, Re-indexing, Iteration, 
# Concatenation, Conversion of data, Visualizations, Aggregations, etc.

# Matplotlib

# This library is responsible for plotting numerical data. And that’s why it is used in data analysis. 
# It is also an open-source library and plots high-defined figures like pie charts, histograms, scatterplots, 
# graphs, etc.
